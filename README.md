# Binary-to-CPP-With-Security-Vulnerabilities

**Overview**

In previous activities, you converted files using languages including binary, assembly, and C++. You have successfully completed a full conversion of legacy code, from binary to C++. In this activity, you will convert legacy binary code to C++, examine the code for security vulnerabilities, fix the identified security vulnerabilities, and report on those vulnerabilities. This is a key step toward the successful completion of Project Two, which is centered on fixing security vulnerabilities. The coding for this assignment will be performed in Codio. You will submit the completed Binary to C++ With Security Vulnerabilities Activity Template Word Document and a new binary file and CPP file.

**Prompt**

Specifically, you must address the following rubric criteria:

Convert the binary file to assembly code.
These files can be found in the Software Reverse Engineering Playground in the Module Six file folder in Codio.
Explain the functionality of the blocks of assembly code.
Use the Binary to C++ With Security Vulnerabilities Activity Template to complete this step.
Convert the assembly code to binary.
Create a new binary file for submission.
Convert the assembly code to C++ code.
Use the Binary to C++ With Security Vulnerabilities Activity Template to complete this step.
Compile the C++ code in the Eclipse integrated development environment.
Identify the security vulnerabilities within the C++ code.
Comment within the C++ code to indicate where the security vulnerabilities are identified.
Fix the identified security vulnerabilities within the C++ code.
Correct the C++ code to fix the security vulnerabilities.
Explain how the updated C++ code fixes the identified vulnerabilities.
Comment within the C++ code to indicate how the security vulnerabilities were fixed.
